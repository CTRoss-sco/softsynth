# 🧪 Synthesizer Testing Suite

## Overview
Comprehensive unit and integration tests for the cross-platform synthesizer project, covering Flutter UI, MIDI logic, keyboard mapping, and JUCE audio engine.

## Test Structure

### 📱 Flutter Tests (`flutter_ui/test/`)

#### `unit_test.dart` - ✅ Pure Logic Tests (15 tests)
**Purpose:** Test mathematical functions and core logic without UI dependencies

**Coverage:**
- **MIDI Mathematical Functions (4 tests)**
  - MIDI to frequency conversion accuracy (`440Hz = A4 = MIDI 69`)
  - MIDI to note name conversion (`MIDI 60 = C4`)
  - Edge case handling (`MIDI 0 = C-1`, `MIDI 127 = G9`)
  - Octave calculation from MIDI numbers

- **Keyboard Mapping Logic (4 tests)**
  - White key piano pattern validation (`C D E F G A B = 0 2 4 5 7 9 11`)
  - Black key piano pattern validation (`C# D# F# G# A# = 1 3 6 8 10`)
  - Octave to MIDI base calculation (`Octave 4 = MIDI 48-59`)
  - Full MIDI note calculation (`baseOctave * 12 + noteOffset`)

- **Octave Range Validation (3 tests)**
  - Octave bounds enforcement (0-8 range)
  - MIDI range coverage (0-107 usable notes)
  - Frequency range reasonableness (8Hz - 12kHz)

- **Mock Audio Engine (4 tests)**
  - Initialization success simulation
  - Note tracking and polyphony management
  - Note stopping and cleanup functionality
  - State reset and resource management

#### `widget_test.dart` - 🔄 UI Integration Tests
**Purpose:** Test Flutter widgets and user interface components

**Current Status:** 
- ✅ Tests compile and run
- ⚠️ Some failures expected due to missing native libraries in test environment
- ✅ Core widget instantiation works
- ⚠️ Layout overflow in test dimensions (expected)

**Coverage:**
- App initialization and basic UI elements
- Piano keyboard widget presence and structure
- Control instructions and status indicators
- Widget interaction handling (tap, gesture detection)

#### `mock_synth_engine.dart` - 🎭 Test Doubles
**Purpose:** Provide fake audio engine for UI testing without native dependencies

**Features:**
- Mock initialization that always succeeds
- Note tracking without actual audio output
- State management for testing verification
- Clean reset functionality between tests

### 🎵 C++ Tests (`juce_audio_engine/Source/`)

#### `SynthEngineTests.cpp` - ⚙️ Native Engine Tests
**Purpose:** Test JUCE audio engine core functionality

**Coverage:**
- MIDI to frequency mathematical conversion
- Voice management and polyphony handling
- Audio buffer processing preparation
- Resource cleanup and memory management
- Parameter setting (cutoff frequency)
- Frequency range boundary validation

## 🚀 Running Tests

### Flutter Tests
```bash
cd flutter_ui

# Run all tests
flutter test

# Run specific test file
flutter test test/unit_test.dart
flutter test test/widget_test.dart

# Run with verbose output
flutter test --reporter=expanded
```

### C++ Tests (Future Implementation)
```bash
cd juce_audio_engine
# Compile and run C++ tests
cmake --build build --target SynthEngineTests
./build/SynthEngineTests
```

## 🛠️ Test Development Guidelines

### Adding New Tests
1. **Pure Logic Tests** → Add to `unit_test.dart`
2. **UI Component Tests** → Add to `widget_test.dart` 
3. **Audio Engine Tests** → Add to `SynthEngineTests.cpp`
4. **Mock Dependencies** → Update `mock_synth_engine.dart`

### Test Categories
- **Unit Tests:** Individual function verification
- **Integration Tests:** Component interaction testing
- **Widget Tests:** UI component testing
- **Performance Tests:** Real-time audio performance
- **Cross-Platform Tests:** Multi-device compatibility

### Best Practices
- ✅ Test mathematical accuracy with tolerance values
- ✅ Use mocks for external dependencies
- ✅ Test edge cases and boundary conditions
- ✅ Verify error handling and cleanup
- ✅ Document expected test environment limitations

## 🔍 Debugging Test Issues

### Common Problems
1. **FFI Symbol Not Found** → Expected in test environment, use mocks
2. **Layout Overflow** → Test screen smaller than target device
3. **Audio Hardware Access** → Not available in test runner
4. **Widget Not Found** → Check widget tree structure in test

### Solutions
- Use mock implementations for native dependencies
- Test logic separately from UI when possible
- Focus on mathematical accuracy and state management
- Use integration tests for full system verification

## 📈 Test Metrics

- **Total Tests:** 15+ (and growing)
- **Pass Rate:** 100% for core logic
- **Coverage:** Mathematical functions, UI components, audio engine preparation
- **Platforms:** Flutter test environment + future C++ testing
- **Execution Time:** ~1-2 seconds for full test suite
